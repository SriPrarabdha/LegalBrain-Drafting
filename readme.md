# Data Annonation for Drafting

## General Instructions on How to Annotate the documents

The process of annotating an RTF document typically involves adding comments, highlighting text, and making other visual or textual indications to provide additional information or context. Here's a general process for annotating an RTF document:

1. Open the RTF document: Use a compatible word processing software such as Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or LibreOffice to open the RTF document.

2. Read the document: Familiarize yourself with the content of the document to understand its structure and identify areas that require annotation.

3. Add comments: Most word processing software allows you to add comments to specific sections of the document. Select the text you want to annotate, right-click, and choose the option to insert a comment. Alternatively, you can use the comment feature available in the software's toolbar or menu.

4. Provide annotations: In the comment or annotation section, type your additional information, insights, or explanations related to the selected text. Make sure your annotations are clear and concise, providing relevant context or insights.

5. Highlight or format text: If desired, you can use the highlighting or formatting options in the word processing software to visually emphasize specific sections of the text. This can help draw attention to important points or make your annotations more visible.

6. Repeat for other sections: Continue reading through the document and adding annotations and comments as necessary. Make sure to cover all the relevant sections, ensuring your annotations are comprehensive.

7. Save the annotated document: Once you have finished adding annotations, save the document to preserve your changes. It is often a good practice to save a separate copy of the annotated document to maintain the original version without annotations.
